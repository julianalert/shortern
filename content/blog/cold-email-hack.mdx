Thsi week has been busy. I shipped Yuzuu's MVP. So I'll go straight, and keep this week's content light.

So... what's the big secret? 

What's the 2-second fix that changes everything? 

## Make your email font bigger

That's it. 

No complex copywriting formulas, no advanced segmentation strategies, no expensive tools. 

**Just bump up that font size and watch your engagement climb.**

I first came across this insight in one of Natia's tweets and thought: 

>  There's no way something this simple actually works

But being a conscientious marketer, I had to test it myself.

## The Results Speak for Themselves

I ran a split test with identical email copy—the only difference was font size. 

The larger font variant consistently outperformed the standard size by roughly 20% in reply rates.

Why does this work? 

My theory: larger text is simply easier to read, especially on mobile devices where most people check their email. 

When your message is effortless to consume, people are more likely to engage with it.

## The Bigger Lesson: Test Everything

This discovery reinforced something crucial about email marketing—small changes can yield significant results, but only if you're systematically testing them.

I run all my campaigns in batches, and whenever I have an idea for improvement (no matter how minor it seems), I test it in the next batch. 

This continuous optimization approach has been key to scaling my email outreach.
