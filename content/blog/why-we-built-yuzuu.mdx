Hey there 👋

If you’re reading this, you’re probably trying to grow your SaaS. Or your agency. 

Or your tiny-but-mighty side project. 

Either way, you’re looking for leads.

And if you’re anything like me, you’re sick of the grind that lead gen has become.

I built Yuzuu because I was tired of spending my mornings buried in LinkedIn tabs, scraping email addresses, testing half-broken tools, and sending messages into the void.

All I wanted was this:
> Just send me a few good leads every day so I can focus on selling. 

Not a list of 2,000 random companies. Not 87 filters and exports. Just a handful of qualified people I could actually talk to.

So I built it. 

And called it Yuzuu.

## 🥶 Lead gen is broken for small & large teams

Everyone tells you to “do outbound.” 

Great. 

But here’s what they don’t tell you:

1. Finding good leads takes forever
2. Most tools give you junk or force you to build crazy workflows
3. You’ll spend hours prospecting… and get ghosted anyway

As a founder or early-stage team, you can’t afford to waste that kind of time. 

You need something simple. Consistent. Actionable.



## 🍋 So here’s what Yuzuu does instead

1.  You give us your website
2.  We figure out who your ideal customers are
3.  Every morning, you get 10 qualified leads in your inbox, with contact info and a reason why they’re a fit

We call it lead gen without the BS.

## 💡 Why just 10 leads?

Because quality beats quantity.

You don’t need 100 random contacts. 

You need 10 people who might actually buy.

And if you want more? You can scale up. 

But we always focus on signal over noise.


## 🧠 What’s next?

This is just the beginning. We’re working on:
1. Smarter lead targeting based on feedback
2. Personalization helpers for your outreach
3. Scale up to 100 leads per day

But the core idea stays the same:

You sell. We find the people. That’s it.

Feel free to reach out anytime. I read every email.

Let’s build cool things and close great deals.
